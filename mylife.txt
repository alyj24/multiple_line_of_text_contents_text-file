A great day to whoever is reading!
Hi! My name is Charl Baguio Albon
I am now 18 years old turning 19 in July.
Currently taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.

I really love dancing.
It feels like a heaven when I'm doing it.
My favorite stress reliver.
I also love dogs.
They gave me a lot of comfort

But now, take care and have a nice day!
